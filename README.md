## Hello, I'm Clayton 👋

I'm a sixth year physics PhD student at New York University in the group of Dries Sels. I work on numerically solving problems in quantum chaos and condensed matter physics, in particular with regards to localization and mainly using tensor network methods. I am also currently looking for a postdoc position in related areas to continue my research.

Check out my repo for generating a Krylov basis and calculating the conserved quantities within it https://github.com/cpeacockc/Localization_in_Krylov_space

Check out my other repo (in progress) for doing basic quantum simulation with sparse and dense matrices https://github.com/cpeacockc/Quantum_simulator

For matrix free quantum simulation methods I recommend and use https://paulistrings.org/dev/ and https://docs.itensor.org/ITensors/stable/

My publications can be found on Google scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORSR8BoAAAAJ
