## Hello, I'm Clayton 👋

I'm a theoretical quantum condensed matter physicist interested in quantum chaos, ergodicity-breaking, disordered systems, and dissipative/driven systems. My work involves developing and applying quantum simulation techniques including Krylov subspace methods, tensor networks, Pauli string binary encoding, and quantum trajectory methods.

Code for generating **Krylov subspace expansions** and computing **localized integrals of motion** for the Anderson model (arXiv:2510.26920) [https://github.com/cpeacockc/Localization_in_Krylov_space](https://github.com/cpeacockc/Anderson-in-Krylov-space)

A **continuous matrix product state Ansatz** for finding ground states of one-dimensional bosons and **Bose-Fermi mixtures** (PhysRevResearch.4.L022034) [https://github.com/cpeacockc/ContinuousMatrixProductStates](https://github.com/cpeacockc/ContinousMatrixProductStates)

Basic **quantum simulation** with sparse and dense matrices https://github.com/cpeacockc/Quantum_simulator

Julia package for performing quantum simulation using **Pauli string binary encoding** https://paulistrings.org/
