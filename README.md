## Hello, I'm Clayton 👋

I'm a quantum condensed matter physicist interested in a range of topics including quantum chaos and ergodicity-breaking, disordered systems, and quantum simulation techniques (Krylov expansions and other sparse methods, tensor networks, pauli string binary encoding)

Repo for generating a Krylov subspace expansion and Lanczos coefficients for the Anderson model and calculating the conserved quantities (or localized integrals of motion) as in  	arXiv:2510.26920 [https://github.com/cpeacockc/Localization_in_Krylov_space](https://github.com/cpeacockc/Anderson-in-Krylov-space)

Repo for constructing continuous matrix product state Ansatz for finding ground states of one-dimensional bosons and Bose-Fermi mixtures as in PhysRevResearch.4.L022034 [https://github.com/cpeacockc/ContinuousMatrixProductStates](https://github.com/cpeacockc/ContinousMatrixProductStates)

Repo for quantum simulation with sparse and dense matrices https://github.com/cpeacockc/Quantum_simulator

Julia package for performing quantum simulation using Pauli string binary encoding (matrix free) https://paulistrings.org/
