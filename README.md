## Hello, I'm Clayton 👋

I'm a PhD candidate at New York University in the group of Dries Sels. I work on numerically solving problems in quantum chaos and condensed matter physics, in particular with systems which evade thermalization through localization by spatial disorder (Anderson, MBL, etc).

Check out my repo for generating a Krylov basis and calculating the conserved quantities within it https://github.com/cpeacockc/Localization_in_Krylov_space

Check out my other repo (in progress) for doing basic quantum simulation with sparse and dense matrices https://github.com/cpeacockc/Quantum_simulator

For matrix free quantum simulation methods I recommend and use https://paulistrings.org/dev/ and https://docs.itensor.org/ITensors/stable/
