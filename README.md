## Hello, I'm Clayton 👋

I'm a quantum condensed matter physicist interested in a range of topics including quantum chaos and ergodicity-breaking, disordered systems, and quantum simulation techniques (Krylov expansions and other sparse methods, tensor networks, pauli string binary encoding)

Check out my repo for generating a Krylov subspace expansion and Lanczos coefficients for the Anderson model and calculating the conserved quantities (or localized integrals of motion) [https://github.com/cpeacockc/Localization_in_Krylov_space](https://github.com/cpeacockc/Anderson-in-Krylov-space)

Check out my other repo (in progress) for doing basic quantum simulation with sparse and dense matrices https://github.com/cpeacockc/Quantum_simulator

For matrix free quantum simulation methods I recommend the following https://paulistrings.org/dev/, https://docs.itensor.org/ITensors/stable/, https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MPSKit.jl
